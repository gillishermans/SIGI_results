# Shape Inference and Grammar Induction from Three-Dimensional Buildings: Examples and Results
Images of buildings examples and new generated buildings for SIGI https://github.com/gillishermans/SIGI.

We generated 5 unenclosed buildings for each example with 20 and 50 production steps and 10 enclosed buildings for each example with 20 and 50 production steps.

Notes:
 - Non-existant images occur for empty productions, such as buildings reduced to nothing by the enclosure constraint.
 - Some enclosed buildings contain buildings seperate from each other. These were connected by one or multiple uncenclosed shapes that were removed during enclosure.

## Examples
For each example we show the example, an unenclosed buildings and an enclosed building.

### Example 1
With alpha = 1.0, rectangular shapes, merge operations, overlap allowed.
