# Shape Inference and Grammar Induction from Three-Dimensional Buildings: Examples and Results
Images of buildings examples and new generated buildings for SIGI https://github.com/gillishermans/SIGI.

We generated 5 unenclosed buildings for each example with 20 and 50 production steps and 10 enclosed buildings for each example with 20 and 50 production steps.

Notes:
 - Some enclosed buildings contain buildings seperate from each other. These were connected by one or multiple uncenclosed shapes that were removed during enclosure.

## Examples
